# Master's Thesis Notebooks

This folder contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks developed as part of the research and analysis conducted for my master's thesis. The notebooks cover various stages of the project, including data exploration, preprocessing, analysis, etc.

## Contents

- **Data Preprocessing Notebook**: This notebook is dedicated to preparing the raw data for analysis. It includes steps such as the *merge* of data from different files, data *exploration* and *cleaning*, feature engineering, and *handling of missing values*. It serves as the foundation for all subsequent analysis since the final dataset that is used in the rest of the notebooks is created.
- **Descriptive Statistics**: Visual and statistical analysis to understand the structure and patterns in the dataset, including *univariate* and *bivariate* analysis.

## Notes

- The notebooks are organized to reflect the logical flow of the thesis work.
- The preprocessing notebook should be executed first to generate the cleaned dataset used by other notebooks.
- All code is written in R and uses standard data science libraries.
